## Cocktails Webapp

It is about an event that is supposed to happen, the user can preorder the entrance for the event and also have a look at the drinks menu that will be available with some useful information.

### About

This project was made with the https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ API; React hooks, sass and css-modules were used.

The app presents a list with a bunch of drinks information such as name, ingredients and instructions allowing the user to search for a specific drink category.
By filling out the form the user can preorder their entrance or if they changed their mind delete it from the local storage with the provided id, once one of those happens a popup will appear for 2 seconds showing a message that the operation was completed.
